/**
 * This class implements a circular buffer of entries, each of which
 * consists of a fine-grain timestamp, a short descriptive string, and
 * a few additional values. It's typically used to record times at
 * various points in an operation, in order to find performance bottlenecks.
 * It can record a trace relatively efficiently (< 10ns as of 6/2016),
 * and then either return the trace either as a string or print it to
 * the system log.
 *
 * This class is thread-safe. By default, trace information is recorded
 * separately for each thread in order to avoid synchronization and cache
 * consistency overheads; the thread-local traces are merged by methods
 * such as printToLog, so the existence of multiple trace buffers is
 * normally invisible.
 *
 * The TimeTrace class should never be constructed; it offers only
 * static methods.
 *
 * If you want to use a single trace buffer rather than per-thread
 * buffers, see the subclass TimeTrace::Buffer below.
